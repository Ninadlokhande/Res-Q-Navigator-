Overview
ResQ Navigator is an autonomous rescue robot designed to assist in emergencies by detecting fire and smoke and responding appropriately.

It combines environmental sensing, obstacle avoidance, and actuation to navigate through hazardous areas safely.

The robot uses sensors like the DHT11 (temperature and humidity), MQ2 (smoke), and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.

An Arduino Uno microcontroller processes sensor data and controls motors via an L298N driver, coordinating movement and activating a water pump to extinguish detected fires.

The primary goal is to aid rescue teams by providing early fire detection and suppression in environments that are dangerous for humans.






Use Cases
Fire Detection and Suppression

Detects rising temperature and smoke concentration in industrial plants, warehouses, or residential buildings.

Automatically activates the water pump to suppress detected fires, minimizing damage.

Search and Rescue Operations

Navigates through debris or hazardous zones where human access is risky or impossible.

Provides real-time data on environmental conditions to rescue teams.

Hazardous Environment Monitoring

Continuously patrols areas prone to fire outbreaks or toxic gas leaks.

Alerts operators before situations escalate.

Educational and Research Tool

Demonstrates integration of sensors, motor control, and autonomous navigation.

Ideal for robotics, embedded systems, and IoT learning projects.






Advantages
Autonomous Operation

Functions independently without constant human control, reducing risk to personnel.

Multi-Sensor Integration

Combines temperature, smoke, and ultrasonic sensors for comprehensive environment monitoring.

Real-Time Response

Immediate detection and activation of safety measures, like a water pump to suppress fires.

Obstacle Avoidance

Ultrasonic sensors allow safe navigation around obstacles, enabling operation in cluttered environments.

Cost-Effective Solution

Uses affordable components like Arduino and common sensors, making it accessible for small organizations and educational institutions.

Modular Design

Easily upgradeable or customizable by adding more sensors or different actuators as needed.
